# üìÖ Scheduling & Calendar Integration

Integrate task and event scheduling into the CRM to enable time-based planning, coordination, and visibility ‚Äî both individually and across teams.

This epic enables users to **plan, view, and manage activities** over time: from follow-up calls to scheduled meetings and internal reminders. By bridging the gap between CRM data and calendar-based workflows, it supports timely action and better coordination.

## CALENDAR VIEW

Displays tasks, events, and meetings in a visual calendar format.

- Supports day/week/month views
- Filterable by user, task type, or status
- Click-to-create new items directly on the calendar
- Color-coded by task status or category (e.g., meeting, follow-up, reminder)

**Why it matters:**  
Visualizing work over time helps avoid overload, overlap, and missed deadlines. It brings structure and focus to otherwise scattered task lists.

---
## EVENT TASKS

Some tasks are time-bound, like meetings or calls. These are treated as **events** and can:

- Include a start/end time  
- Trigger reminders/notifications  
- Be added to external calendars (Google, Outlook, etc.)

**Examples:**
- ‚ÄúDemo call with ACME Corp. on Tuesday, 11:00‚Äì11:45‚Äù
- ‚ÄúKickoff meeting with design team‚Äù

**Why it matters:**  
Users expect calendar behavior: date + time = event. Treating these tasks differently improves clarity and sync.

---
## EXTERNAL CALENDAR SYNC *(Optional Scope)*

Sync CRM tasks/events with external calendars via integration:

- One-way (CRM ‚Üí Calendar) or two-way (bi-directional)
- Individual user consent/auth required
- Respect permissions (e.g., private vs public events)

**Why it matters:**  
Many users already live in their calendar apps. Syncing CRM tasks ensures visibility and follow-through without double entry.
