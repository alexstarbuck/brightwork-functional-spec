# üìû Call Center Integration

This epic enables integrated phone communication workflows inside the CRM ‚Äî both inbound and outbound ‚Äî ensuring that calls, contacts, and tasks live in one place.

The goal is to replace context switching between CRM and PBX software with a seamless experience.

## BASIC VOIP INTEGRATIONS

Connect to common SIP-based VoIP systems or cloud platforms (e.g. Twilio, 3CX, Asterisk).
