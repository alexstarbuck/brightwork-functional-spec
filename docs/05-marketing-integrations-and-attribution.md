# ðŸ“£ Marketing Integrations & Attribution

This epic connects marketing efforts (ads, campaigns, content) with actual CRM outcomes. It closes the loop between lead generation and customer conversion.

Instead of just tracking clicks or impressions, we track which specific campaigns brought in which leads â€” and how those leads performed over time.

---
## GOOGLE & META ADS INTEGRATIONS

Pull lead data from platforms like Metaâ€™s Instant Forms, match UTM parameters, and associate ad spend with CRM contacts.

**Why it matters:**  
You know which ad spend produced real pipeline, not just engagement.

---
## UTM TAGGING & PARSING

Automatically capture UTM parameters from incoming traffic or submitted forms.

Fields:
- `utm_source`
- `utm_medium`
- `utm_campaign`
- `utm_term` / `utm_content` (optional)

---
## CAMPAIGN â†’ LEAD ATTRIBUTION CHAIN

Map every lead to the original marketing source â€” and track what happens to that lead (converted, churned, lifetime value).

---
## IN-CRM CAMPAIGN PERFORMANCE DASHBOARD

Display metrics for each campaign:
- Leads generated  
- Conversion rates  
- Cost per lead  
- ROI (if cost data available)

---
## EMAIL / WHATSAPP CAMPAIGN TRACKING

For built-in or integrated campaigns, track opens, clicks, replies â€” tied back to CRM contacts.

---
## OPTIONAL: WEBHOOK-BASED INTEGRATIONS

Allow external platforms to push marketing event data into CRM using custom webhook endpoints.

---
## Why it matters

With this, marketing stops being a black box. You can run growth experiments and measure success in terms of actual business impact â€” not just impressions and vanity metrics.
