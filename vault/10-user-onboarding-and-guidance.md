# 🎯 User Onboarding & Guidance

This epic ensures that new users of the CRM feel oriented, guided, and confident — from the first login to their first success.

It focuses on onboarding flows, tooltips, contextual help, and graceful handling of empty states (no data yet).

---
## WELCOME EXPERIENCE

First login or new user flow.

- Friendly welcome message  
- Optional product tour or checklist  
- Quick links to key actions (Add Contact, Import CSV…)

---
## EMPTY STATES DESIGN

Pages with no data should teach, not confuse.

- “No contacts yet? Add your first one here.”  
- Visuals + concise guidance on what to do next  
- Consistent across modules (Contacts, Tasks, Notes…)

---
## TOOLTIPS & INLINE HELP

Lightweight UI helpers for fields, buttons, or screens.

- “What is Status?” — hover to see short explanation  
- “How do I add a contact?” — inline CTA or guide

---
## CONTEXTUAL SETUP REMINDERS

Gentle nudges when key features are unconfigured.

- “Set up email sync to track conversations.”  
- “Enable fiscalization to issue valid invoices.”

---
## Why it matters

Even the best features go unused if people don’t understand them. Good onboarding reduces churn, lowers support costs, and increases time-to-value.
