# Writing Style Guidelines

Each Epic page should include:

- A clear, concise overview paragraph.
- Breakdown into major components (e.g., Contacts, Tasks...).
- Contextual examples for each.
- Why each feature matters from a user or business perspective.

## Tone

- Professional, yet accessible.
- Write as if explaining to a smart but non-technical colleague.
- Keep formatting clean and scannable.

Avoid deep technical details â€” those belong in Dev Wiki.
