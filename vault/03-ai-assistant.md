# 🤖 AI Assistant & Automation

This epic introduces intelligent assistance across the CRM — helping users search, summarize, predict, and act faster using embedded AI.

It reduces manual effort, suggests next steps, and alerts teams before issues arise.

---
## CONVERSATIONAL INTERFACE

Use natural language to interact with the CRM.

- “What leads did Mark handle last week?”  
- “Show me customers at risk of churn.”  
- Auto-generate tasks or notes from chat

---
## SMART SEARCH & FUZZY MATCHING

Search with plain language — not exact field matches.

- “Ana from Split” matches “Ana Kovač (Split)”  
- Works across contacts, tasks, and notes

---
## FIELD SUGGESTIONS & AUTOFILL

Suggest field values based on historical patterns.

- Common titles, company names, tags  
- Auto-fill from email signatures

---
## LEAD INSIGHTS & PREDICTIONS

Highlight leads likely to convert — or churn.

- Use historical data (engagement, timing, tags)  
- Display confidence score or “next action” suggestions

---
## PIPELINE ANOMALY DETECTION

Detect drop-offs or unusual patterns in deal flow.

- Alert if too many leads stuck in one stage  
- Spot missing follow-ups

---
## Why it matters

Most CRMs are reactive. AI allows us to shift to a *proactive* system — one that anticipates needs, reduces friction, and augments user decisions instead of just storing data.
